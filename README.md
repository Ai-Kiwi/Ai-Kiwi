# Hi there!
I'm Ai Kiwi, a developer based in New Zealand. I'm passionate about creating and learning about all the ways that computers work and interact with each other. If I were to put myself as a front end or back end developer I would conserder myself as a backend developer, I find it exstremyly interesting learning about all the tools, techniques and software used to deploy servers, I find it really interesting learning about all the protocals the internet uses and how networking works. I also find myself getting alot of enjoyment out of alot of different areas whether it be game modding, the theroy and practice behind how computers work, or messing with Linux stuff such as single gpu passthrough. 

A large interest of mine you will notice on my GitHub project is a Minecraft mod called CC-Tweaked, I have made several programs related to it which you can find laying around on my github profile. Although very few of my projects and learning endeavors make there way into my GitHub, you can still find some of the things I'm working on now and again scattered around my profile. I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge, I always enjoy learning new things and taking on challenging projects.

If you'd like to chat or work together on a project, feel free to reach out to me on Discord at @aikiwi or by email at aikiwi@skiff.com. Also, I have a website at aikiwi.dev, although at the time of writing this, it's merely a backend for some of my projects.

Thanks for stopping by!
