# Hi there!
I'm Ai Kiwi, a backend developer based in New Zealand. I'm passionate about creating and learning about all the ways that servers work. My main focus is on backend development, however I do accselly do front end development when needed, I also enjoy tinkering with electronic projects and front-end development, as well as a bunch of other random things. At the moment, I'm particularly interested in a Minecraft mod called CC Tweaked and have made several programs related to it, you can find some of those laying around on my github.

Although I don't post a lot on GitHub, you can find some of the things I'm working on now and again scattered around my profile. I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge, and I enjoy learning about new things and taking on challenging projects.

If you'd like to chat or work together on a project, feel free to reach out to me on Discord at Ai Kiwi#0759. Also, I have a website at aikiwi.dev, although at the time of writing this, it's merely a backend for some of my projects.

Thanks for stopping by!
