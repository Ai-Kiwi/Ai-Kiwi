### Hi I'm ðŸ‘‹ Ai Kiwi 
I'm a passionate programmer from New Zealand that does programming for the hobbie factor.  
My current skill set involes the following.  
C, C++, C#, javascript, python, css, html, nodejs, nginx, aws ec2, blender, batch, photoshop, unity, linux, windows, git, ardiuno, 3d printing.  
Though I don't know much about the majority of these, I have learned the fundamentals because I once needed them for a project.

If you would like to reach out to me or do a collaboration with me contact me at contact@aikiwi.tech.
