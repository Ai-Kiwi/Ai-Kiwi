Hello,

I’m Ai Kiwi, a developer based in New Zealand with a strong interest in how computers operate and communicate. I specialize in backend development, and I’m particularly passionate about infrastructure, networking, and the systems that power modern applications. I enjoy diving into areas like internet protocols, server deployment, and Linux-based setups such as single GPU passthrough. I also explore other technical interests including game modding and low-level computer theory.

One of my active projects is https://HistorySaber.com — a website that tracks and displays historical ScoreSaber leaderboards for Beat Saber. It’s built using SvelteKit on the frontend and backed by a PostgreSQL database. This project combines my interest in data, performance tracking, and web development.

In the past, I also developed PlateRates, a mobile app designed for sharing food creations and receiving community ratings. The app was built with Flutter, initially using a Node.js backend with MongoDB, and later migrated to a more performant Rust backend with PostgreSQL.

Additionally, I’ve contributed programs to the Minecraft mod CC-Tweaked, which can be found on my GitHub. While many of my experiments and side projects remain private, some of my work is occasionally published and shared on my profile.

I’m always looking to take on new challenges, learn new technologies, and collaborate on meaningful projects. If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out via Discord at @aikiwi or email me at contact@aikiwi.dev. My personal site is available at https://aikiwi.dev, currently serving as a backend hub for some of my projects.

Thank you for visiting!
