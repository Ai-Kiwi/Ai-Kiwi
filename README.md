### Hi I'm ðŸ‘‹ Ai Kiwi 
I'm a passionate programmer from New Zealand that does programming for the hobbie factor. 

my current skill set involes the following.
c, C++, c#, javascript, python, css, html, nodejs, nginx, aws ec2, blender, batch, photoshop, unity, linux, windows, git, ardiuno. 
Though I don't know much about the majority of these, I have learned the fundamentals because I once needed them for a project.

if you would like to reach out to me contact me at contact@aikiwi.tech
