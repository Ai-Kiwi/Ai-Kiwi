# Hi there! 
I'm Ai Kiwi, a backend developer based in New Zealand. I'm passionate about creating and learning about all the ways that servers work. My main focus is on backend development, but I also enjoy tinkering with electronic projects and front-end development, as well as a bunch of other random things. At the moment, I'm particularly interested in a Minecraft mod called CC Tweaked and have made several programs related to it.

I'm also interested in networking and how it contributes to the functioning of servers and applications. Understanding networking concepts is crucial for designing scalable, efficient, and secure applications. I'm always looking for opportunities to improve my networking skills and expand my knowledge in this field.

Although I don't post a lot on GitHub, you can find some of the things I'm working on now and again scattered around my profile. I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge, and I enjoy learning about new things and taking on challenging projects.

If you'd like to chat or work together on a project, feel free to reach out to me on Discord at Ai Kiwi#0759 (don't worry, I don't bite). Also, I have a website at aikiwi.dev, although at the time of writing this, it's merely a backend for some of my projects.

Thanks for stopping by!
