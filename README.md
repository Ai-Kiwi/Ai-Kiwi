Hello,

I’m Ai Kiwi, a developer based in New Zealand with a strong interest in how computers work and their underlying software works. I enjoy fullstack development as well. I enjoy learning how and why software works. 

One of my active projects is https://HistorySaber.com — a website that tracks and displays historical ScoreSaber leaderboards for a popular VR game called Beat Saber. It’s built using SvelteKit on the frontend and backed by a PostgreSQL database. 

In the past, I also developed PlateRates, a mobile app designed for sharing food creations and receiving community ratings. The app was built with Flutter for the  front end. Initially the website was coded using MongoDB nodejs however I later changed to postgresql as I thought it would be a better fit and along with it decided to make the switch to rust to learn how it worked and it also had the added benefits of being much more performant. 

Currently I am also working on a game which will be made up of small voxels, this game is programmed using rust with the gpu api wgpu for rendering. I find this project quite interesting at the moment because of how indepth it goes with learning how the gpu works and being able to use it to benefit my software. 

Additionally, I’ve worked on programs to the Minecraft mod CC-Tweaked, which can be found on my GitHub. While many of my experiments and side projects remain private, some of my work is occasionally published and shared on my profile. Many of these projects are from a long time ago so quality varies. 

I’m always looking to take on new challenges, learn new technologies, and collaborate on meaningful projects. If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out via contact@aikiwi.dev. My personal site is available at https://aikiwi.dev.
